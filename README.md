# Window_Cleaning_Cost_Calculator

A Co-Worker of mine approached me with an intresting critical thinking question. 
If you were hired to wash 1000 windows, how much would you charge and how would you justify your cost?
I was too lazy to take out a calculator or do the math in my head to create realisitc numbers, so I just made an algorithm to do it instead!
